# Analyze the ETF Portfolio
Project Title


## Analyze a Single Asset in the ETF

For this part of the assignment, you’ll use SQL queries with Python, Pandas, and hvPlot to analyze the performance of a single asset from the ETF.

Complete the following steps:

Write a SQL SELECT statement by using an f-string that reads all the PYPL data from the database. Using the SQL SELECT statement, execute a query that reads the PYPL data from the database into a Pandas DataFrame.

Use the head and tail functions to review the first five and the last five rows of the DataFrame. Make a note of the beginning and end dates that are available from this dataset. You’ll use this information to complete your analysis.

Using hvPlot, create an interactive visualization for the PYPL daily returns. Reflect the “time” column of the DataFrame on the x-axis. Make sure that you professionally style and format your visualization to enhance its readability.

Using hvPlot, create an interactive visualization for the PYPL cumulative returns. Reflect the “time” column of the DataFrame on the x-axis. Make sure that you professionally style and format your visualization to enhance its readability.

## Optimize Data Access with Advanced SQL Queries

For this part of the assignment, you’ll continue to analyze a single asset (PYPL) from the ETF. You’ll use advanced SQL queries to optimize the efficiency of accessing data from the database.

Complete the following steps:

Access the closing prices for PYPL that are greater than 200 by completing the following steps:

Write a SQL SELECT statement to select the dates where the PYPL closing price was higher than 200.0.

Using the SQL statement, read the data from the database into a Pandas DataFrame, and then review the resulting DataFrame.

Select the “time” and “close” columns for those dates where the closing price was higher than 200.0.

Find the top 10 daily returns for PYPL by completing the following steps:

Write a SQL statement to find the top 10 PYPL daily returns. Make sure to do the following:

Use SELECT to select only the “time” and “daily_returns” columns.

Use ORDER to sort the results in descending order by the “daily_returns” column.

Use LIMIT to limit the results to the top 10 daily return values.

Using the SQL statement, read the data from the database into a Pandas DataFrame, and then review the resulting DataFrame.
